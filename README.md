# Private-Valorant-Instalocker

How it works:
A tool written in Python used to instalock agents in VALORANT using the local API. This is NOT a hotkey program of any kind. This program exclusively uses the Valorant Local API to lock your agent. I have no idea if this is bannable or not, and I certainly don't take any responsibilty for what you do with this.

Features:
- Any agent at ANY resolution
- Automatic instalock with api
- instalock before even the loading screen

Problems and Bugs:
- It won't be updated
- Unfeatured character Fade

Installaton
1.Download the zip from [here](https://github.com/NotOgata/Private-Valorant-Instalocker/releases).
2.Extract the files, making sure the executable and the config.ini file end up in the same directory

How to use:
1.Start VALORANT
2.Open VALORANT Instalocker.exe
3.Upon first launch, the program will perform a one-time setup asking you for your region. Use the arrow keys to navigate the selection menu, and press enter to confirm 4.your selection.
5.Use the arrow keys to select your agent role, and then your agent. Once you see the message You may now start the match queue, begin searching for a match.
6.EZ.

Important to note that the speed it locks in an agent is limited on how fast you get off the loading screen.
